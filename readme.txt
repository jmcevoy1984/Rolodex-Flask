#Basic C.R.U.D Rolodex Aplication

A basic C.R.U.D application designed to be a staff rolodex.

Uses the following libraries:

Flask (Web MVC Micro-Framework)
Flask Migrate
Flask Restful
Flask Uploads
Flask WTF (For WTF Forms)
FLask Login
Flask Sqlalchemy (Wrapper for Python SQLalchemy)
CherryPy (Python HTTP server)
Pillow (Updated for of PIL [Python Imaging Library)

On the frontend I used plain Javascript with AJAX calls to the REST API in the backend.

I used the Bootstrap framework for CSS.
